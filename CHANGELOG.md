# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.1] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- The SignalK path field on devices suggests paths from the vessel's live
  data tree as you type. Several words match in any order, and any text is
  still accepted so a path can be documented before it exists.

### Fixed

- Creating a circuit, wire run, device or plan, and importing a CSV,
  failed with "crypto.randomUUID is not a function" when the webapp was
  loaded over plain http, which is how most boat LANs serve SignalK. Ids
  are now generated in a way that works without a secure context.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Floorplan tab: upload top-down and side drawings (SVG, PNG, JPEG or
  WebP), calibrate each with two clicks and a real distance, place
  devices by clicking in either view (one 3D position shown in both),
  and draw wire run routes with a measured 3D length offered next to the
  recorded length. Circuits can name a panel device that routes start
  from, and selecting a circuit highlights its devices and routes.
- Devices gain `posX`, `posY`, `posZ`; wire runs gain `route`; circuits
  gain `panelDeviceId`; a new `wiringPlans` resource. Existing databases
  migrate automatically.

### Fixed

- The plugin configuration had no effect. The default gauge and length
  units now pre-select on new wire run forms, and the wiring convention
  sets the colour field's example placeholder. The settings are served
  read-only at `wiringSettings/config`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Circuit `voltage` and `breakerRating` (numeric, splits out of the old
  free-text `source`), wire run `cableLabel`/`switchRef`/`lengthUnit`,
  and device `ratedPowerW`/`signalkPath` fields.
- CSV import: upload a spreadsheet, map its columns to wiring fields (or
  skip them), preview the resulting circuits/wire runs/devices, then
  import — generic column mapping, not tied to one spreadsheet's layout.
- Panel load summary: per active circuit, total connected devices' rated
  wattage converted to amps via the circuit's voltage and checked
  against its breaker rating, flagging circuits over their rating.

### Changed

- `circuit.source` renamed to `sourceLabel`. Existing installations
  migrate automatically on first start after upgrading — no manual
  action needed.

### Fixed

- Numeric form fields (gauge, length, etc.) silently rejected decimal
  values (e.g. `3.5`) due to a missing `step` attribute on the input.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-23

Initial release — the full MVP scope from SPEC.md §10.1.

### Added

- Circuit / wire run / device data model, exposed as SignalK resource
  types (`wiringCircuits`, `wiringWireRuns`, `wiringDevices`) with
  anonymous reads and admin-gated writes.
- Removed-but-kept record lifecycle: "removing" a record marks it
  `removed` instead of deleting it.
- Per-record change log (creation, field-level diffs on edit, removal),
  with a webapp view.
- Photo/file attachment upload, viewing, and deletion per wire run or
  device.
- Auto-generated per-circuit wiring diagram (source → wire run(s) →
  device(s)), computed and rendered client-side.
- Admin webapp: browse/search circuits and devices, inline create/edit
  forms, all built on vendored Preact + `htm` with no CDN dependency and
  no build step, so the plugin works with no internet connectivity.
- Configurable wiring convention setting (ABYC E-11 / DIN EN ISO 13297 /
  freestyle) — drives UI labeling hints only, never enforced.
